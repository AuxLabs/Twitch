# Twitch

Twitch is an implementation of the [Twitch Developer API](https://dev.twitch.tv/) that aims to reformat the data provided by these APIs into a more standardized structure where possible, present itself in a way that isn't overly complicated for a beginner to understand, and cover compatibility for modern platforms. Currently, only the base-level implementation is available via the `*.Api` libraries.
